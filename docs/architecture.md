# Architecture
* **Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2.0 (512MB)**: *we want a dedicated machine for this, so (mostly out of convenience since it was just lying around) we chose this older model which should be sufficient in terms of memory and ethernet.*
* **Raspbian Stretch-lite**: *we don't need a desktop environment so this lite os is perfect.*
* **Nginx**: *for reverse proxying.*
* **ddclient**: *for dynamic DNS cleint.*
