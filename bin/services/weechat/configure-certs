  # NOTE: (aguestuser)
  # - freenode and OFTC only allow users to connect over tor via TLS SASL (fine)
  # - but they require you to *FIRST* register TLS cert via a clearnet connection
  #   authentcicated with basic authe (ie: username/password)
  # - :. we *FIRST* create the cert for these two servers over clearnet connection 
  #   using same steps as all other servers (which happen to be connected over tor)
  # - *THEN* we configure freenode and OFTC for tor and reconnect via TLS SASL
  #   (which now is allowed over tor b/c we have already authed the certs via clearnet/basic auth)
  # - in the case of freenode, we must also change the address of the service to an onion
  #   address (since they only tor connections to this address) before reconnecting over tor

  # SAD TODO (aguestuser|23 Apr 2018):
  # - try as i might, i simply cannot get this script to reliably work for freenode and OFTC
  #   although all the steps work when performed manually (VERY frustrating)
  # - clue: i *think* it has something to do with timing. it is posisble that issuing the command
  #   to register the cert does not have time to complete before the command to reconnect via
  #   tor is issued. i have experimented with issuing `/wait Nms` commands, but they don't actually
  #   seem to cause the script to pause. =(
  # - as a workaround, i have disabled the script for freenode, AND you can run all of the 
  #   steps listed below manually (referenced in configure-certs-manually.md) and it will work
  # - left as TODO to figure out why this is necessary. :mega-sad-face:
